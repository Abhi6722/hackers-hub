Today here I’m going to share about what is kali linux for you all. So that by this “what is kali linux” article you can turn out to be master entrance android analyzer and programmer, And I’m damn certain that you will never get all these extraordinary data like us on the web anyplace else. 

## What is kali linux 
Folks in ongoing posts we gain information about what is hacking, how to turn into a programmer so I trust you read those articles and got answers for your inquiries. So now right now, will go to find out about hacking os which is likewise called as Linux and most pentesters os. so how about we begin… 

These days Linux is the best and most utilized open source working framework. As a working framework that sits underneath and the entirety of the other programming on a PC, getting demands from those programs and transferring this sort solicitations to the PC’s equipment.

- Architects to make UIs and designs of projects were disseminated with different projects. 
- Scholars who can make documentation, how-tos, and other significant content disseminated with the product. 
- Interpreters to take projects and documentation from their local dialects and make them open to individuals around the globe. 
- Bundles to take programming projects and set up all the parts to ensure they run faultlessly in various circulations.
