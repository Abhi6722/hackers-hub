## True Open Source

Compared to many platforms in the ecosystem, Hackers Hub is a truly open source project that is run with open governance and owned by [Abhinav Kumar](https://abhi6722.in). This legally binds the project to grow and be directed in the interest of all participants. The project team values openness and collaboration and is not driven by monetary interests.

This makes the project independent in how it is being developed and where it is supposed to go. It allows us to provide a free 24/7 support in our [community channel](https://gitter.im/official-hackers-hub/community) as we build a sustainable community that supports and learns from each other. Lastly, it gives a lot of opportunities to the people that contribute and engage with the project due to its [open governance](https://github.com/Abhi6722/hackers-hub/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).
